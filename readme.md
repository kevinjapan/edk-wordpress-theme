# WordPress Theme

This was a first/early pass at learning WordPress theme development - there are plenty of mistakes and wrong paths
trodden herein. It did pass the wordpress.org automated tests for theme submission on that site, but had couple of 
minor issues with the manual testing which I have not fixed. Currently, this is parked and left here only to show
my past learning efforts.
